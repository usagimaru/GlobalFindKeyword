The find string sharing feature is not well known on the macOS platform today. Familiar examples include the search fields in Xcode and Safari. Some users see it as a bug, but itâ€™s an intentionally designed feature that has existed since older Mac OS X (or NeXTSTEP).

This project is a small code that uses NSPasteboard to work with the global find buffer on macOS. This provides a traditional find experience.


## Read and write with NSPasteboardNameFind

```swift
// Get the find string from the global find buffer.
let findPBoard = NSPasteboard(name: .find)
let findString = findPBoard.string(forType: .string)

// Set the find string to the global find buffer.
let findString = "hello"
let findPBoard = NSPasteboard(name: .find)
findPBoard.clearContents()
findPBoard.setString(findString, forType: .string)
```
